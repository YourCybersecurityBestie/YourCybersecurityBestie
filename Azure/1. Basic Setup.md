## Step 3: Connecting Your Repo to VSCode

1. **Install Git**:
   - If you haven't already, download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open VSCode.
   - Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
   - Type `Git: Clone` and select it.
   - Enter the URL of your repository: `https://github.com/YourCybersecurityBestie/YourCybersecurityBestie.git`.
   - Choose a local directory where the repository will be cloned.

3. **Open the Repository in VSCode**:
   - Once the repository is cloned, VSCode will prompt you to open the cloned repository.
   - Click "Open" to open the repository in VSCode.

4. **Authenticate with GitHub** (if prompted):
   - You may be asked to sign in to GitHub to authenticate your actions.
   - Follow the prompts to complete the authentication.

Now your repository is connected to VSCode, and you can manage your files, commit changes, and push to GitHub directly from VSCode.

## Step 4: Set Up VSCode for Azure Deployment
1. **Sign in to Azure**:
    - Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Azure: Sign In`, and follow the prompts to authenticate.
2. **Create and Deploy Resources**:
    - Use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to define your infrastructure.
    - Use the Azure App Service extension to deploy apps directly from VSCode.
3. **Configure Azure Functions**:
    - Create new functions and configure them using the Azure Functions extension.
    - Debug and test your functions locally before deploying them to Azure.
