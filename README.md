My journey in this field has been a blend of continuous learning and community engagement, with a focus on making cybersecurity more accessible to everyone, especially women in tech.

Growing up in the digital era, I have always been surrounded by technology. My early experiences with computers involved dial-up modems, which sparked my interest in cybersecurity.Today, as the founder of Cyber Queen, I am driven to address the lack of female representation in the cybersecurity industry, which has resulted in increased vulnerability to cyber threats. I believe that we need more diversity, within all categories to make our networks and information assets secure.

My goal is to empower women to excel in cybersecurity careers by providing the necessary tools, strategies, and support. Whether you follow my blogs, social media, and newsletters, I want you to feel empowered by what you learn and how it will elevate you in your career. As a female working in a male-dominated industry, I understand the challenges that women face in pursuing a cybersecurity career. That's why Cyber Queen was created as a platform for women to find the support and encouragement they need to succeed in this field.
